The Vision of this project is to

# Increase QUALITY and EFFICIENCY of product design and development workflows

by enabling a team to create abstractions around user interface related
decisions.

</sg-highlight>

Can't wait? Here's how to [get started](~/docs/getting-started)!

### What? abstractions, user interface, decisions?! Could you please elaborate!?

## A brief introduction on why we think a styleguide is an important tool

Building software products is a **complex** task. It's so complex that we
need teams or even whole companies to do it.  
And in these teams we have multiple specialists that care for very specific
aspects of the product.

For example a **designer** is concerned with the looks of the product:  
Are the contrasts just right? Does everything fit with the corporate identity?  
A **UX person** cares for the behavior of the product:  
Is a flow understandable? Do we use learned patterns or reinvent the wheel?  
And a **developer** will most likely focus on the implementation of the product:  
Does it work on all platforms? Is the code I write maintainable?

...plus much more...

## It's Complex

![individual trying to think all of the above complexity](/img/individual_thinking_to_much_complex_stuff.jpg)

Unwanted complexity is not only created by our teammates, but also by past
versions of ourselves  
â€“ most of the time one individual can not keep everything
in mind.

## Good News is: Complexity can be contained in abstractions

![abstraction of complex stuff](/img/abstraction_of_complex_stuff.jpg)

We use abstractions every day. **Vue.js** is an abstraction around all the
complex implementation details of view handling, state management and
application architecure. **Nuxt** even goes one step further and creates an
abstraction around the build tools for our product.  
Only a minority of the people using vue and nuxt actually know the source code
of these products. Thats the benefit of an **abstraction**!

**Sketch** would be another example. As a user of sketch I do not need to know
about the details that make a correct vector or image file. I also do not need
to paint each shape by putting in coordinates and vectors. The user interface
abstracts these away.

## A good abstraction

![individual thinking abstraction](/img/individual_thinking_abstraction.jpg)

Once we have a good abstraction, an individual does not need to care about the
internal complexity. Which is a huge **timesaver** and **quality-booster**.  
This person can now care for other stuff. Or that person might want to improve
the abstraction, in which case one needs to dive into the underlying complexity.
But that's a explicit decision and therefore totally fine.

## How to capture the complexity of product development?

You might have guessed by now, our answer is `nuxt-styleguide`.

There are [tons of other solutions](https://designsystemsrepo.com/) with
different category names (like: pattern library, component library,
design system, ux-documentation, ...). They might focus on different aspects,
but in general they all try to solve the same problem.

So while creating your product, lots of difficult questions will arise.
The answers will require even more difficult decisions to be made which create
**complexity**.
`nuxt-styleguide` is meant to help you capture these decisions in a living
system and will hopefully enable you to create abstractions across them so that
future versions of yourself and other team members can be efficient in creating
high quality products.
