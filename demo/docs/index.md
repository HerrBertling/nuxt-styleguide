# Welcome to `@sum.cumo/nuxt-styleguide`

The main goal of this project is to help designers, design ops and developers
to find an ubiquitous language about the stuff they work on.
This language has proven to simplify every day communication and streamline
the application development process from prototyping to deployment.

Once this is achieved it will also be helpful when new team members
need to be on-boarded to the project or some aspects of the user interface
need to be explained to someone external (a client for example).

We call this a "systematic design and development process".
